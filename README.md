### IMDb-Inspired Website Project

This project is a simplified IMDb clone, developed using **.NET MVC** with **Entity Framework** (ORM) and structured following **Clean Architecture** principles. The goal of this project was to deepen my understanding of **relational databases**, **object-oriented programming (OOP)**, and **building basic user interfaces**. 

Key functionalities implemented include:
- **Creating and managing movies**
- **Adding actors and editing their profiles**
- **Editing movie details**
- **Adding and updating ratings**

To enhance the architecture and maintain clean, scalable code, I integrated key components such as:
- **Fluent Validation** for robust data validation
- **MediatR** for handling CQRS patterns and decoupling business logic
- **AutoMapper** for efficient object-to-object mapping

While the focus was on backend logic and database relationships using the **.NET stack**, the design remained minimal as it was not a primary concern for this learning project. All core features are fully functional.
